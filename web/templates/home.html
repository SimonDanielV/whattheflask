          <p> This is an example of a web app, built from scratch using Flask.
          Flask is a mirco web framework - written in Python - and is used
          worldwide for building web applications. This web application shows
          how the back and front end of an web in Flask could look like, and
          shows the possibility of how a user can interact with Data Science
          models written in Python. All the code is open sourced and avaiable
          on the <a href="https://github.com/SimonDanielV/whattheflask">github
          </a>.</p>

          <p> The web app contains a page where you can ask for a random number
          between a given range, and a page where you can ask for a prediction
          on a list of numeric values. </p>
